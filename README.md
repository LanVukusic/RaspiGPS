# RaspiGPS üì°
## RaspberryPi GPS library written in Go for interfacing with GPS serial hardware
This is a library that was written to work with any serial enabled gps module. I had only an option to test the Neo 8 gps, but it should work with any NMEA compliant device. It was written for a series of serial enabled extension boards available from [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32325428866.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dH6kF1l)  
Please leave a star if you end up using this library. It means a tone to me ‚≠ê 
   

### Hardware list:   
__Tested hardware:__  
* [Ublox Neo M8N](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-m8-series). I tested [this](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32325428866.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dH6kF1l) one  

__Probably working hardware:__  
All serial and Nmea compliant GPS modules
* Probably all Ublox series gps
* Contact me if you find that your device works

### Pinout:  
Pins on the raspberry are labeled according to the diagram below, referenced with numbers running from 1 to 40  

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LanVukusic/RaspiGPS/master/pinout.png" width="800">

* __PIN 8__ serial TX (gpio15)    -  gps RX
* __PIN 10__ serial RX (gpio14)   -  gps TX



### Library is dependent on an external library:  
* [go serial library](https://github.com/jacobsa/go-serial) - github.com/jacobsa/go-serial  


Here is a sample code which connects and recieves data from a gps module.  


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"./gps"
)

var a gps.Neo8

func main() {
	// replace "/dev/serial0" with the serial interface you are using
	a.Init("/dev/serial0")

	for {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		fmt.Printf("Position: %g %s, %g %s with %d satelites\n", a.Lat, a.NS, a.Lng, a.WE, a.SatTracking)
	}

}

```
